                    FreeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization that consists of an interactive learning web platform, an online community forum, chat rooms, online publications and local organizations that intend to make learning web development accessible to anyone. 
                    Beginning with tutorials that introduce students to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, students progress to project assignments that they complete either alone or in pairs. Upon completion of all project tasks, students are partnered with other nonprofits to build web applications, giving the students practical development experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our mission: to help people learn to code for free. 
                    We accomplish this by creating thousands of videos, articles, and interactive coding lessons - all freely available to the public. 
                    We also have thousands of freeCodeCamp study groups around the world.
                </p>

                <h2>What will you learn with us?</h2>

                <p>
                    The self-paced curriculum involves 1,400 hours of interactive coding challenges and web development projects, plus 800 hours of contributing to open-source projects for nonprofits and is constantly expanded by more challenges and projects. 
                    This translates into about one year of full-time coding. The curriculum is divided into Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, Front End Libraries, Data Visualization, APIs and Microservices, and Information Security and Quality Assurance. Participants receive a certificate after completing each section.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The curriculum emphasizes pair programming, intended to foster a culture of collaboration and shared learning, which can overcome a student's doubts about the adequacy of their skills (popularly referred to as “impostor syndrome”).
                </p>

                <p>
                    The languages and technologies currently taught by freeCodeCamp include HTML5, CSS 3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Git.
